		New planet discovered has a massive ocean and it's not too far from Earth

		TOI-733b
	</h2>

	<p>
		245 light years away is where the scientific community discovered a new planet, TOI-733b. Interestingly, its size is slightly less than twice the radius of Earth. However that's not what makes this planet stand out, it is its atmosphere. Experts havepresented two possibilites, the first being that it may have lost its atmosphere layer. Second is that it could be a <q>highly irradiated oceanic world</q> (earth.com).

		Exoplanets
	</h2>

	<p>
		We live in a fascinating world where today's curiosity has the opportunity to focus on a very specific type of celestial body: exoplanets and moons that might host oceans. Scientists believe that these water-bearing worlds could potentially harbor life, making them a focal point in our search for extraterrestrial organisms. The discovery of exoplanets — planets orbiting stars outside our solar system — has been a game-changer in our quest for alien life. A few of these new planets, thanks to their favorable conditions, show potential for hosting oceans.
